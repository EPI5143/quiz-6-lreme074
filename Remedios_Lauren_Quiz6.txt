/*a) How many patients had at least 1 inpatient encounter that started in 2003? 
I am going to create a separate dataset for each question, for this question I 
will create a flat file dataset that includes only data from 2003 onwards and one row per patient*/

/*STEP 1 creating copy of nencounters table*/
data encounters;
set classdat.nencounter;

/*STEP 2 including only observations that occurred from 2003 onwards*/

/*ANSWER: based on the log, the final dataset had N=3967 observations.
Since we had already made this dataset to only include INPT
encounters AND we had flat filed it by patient id, every observation row/patient should have at least 1 
INPT encounter. So N=3967 is the # of patients that had 1 or more INPT encounters.*/

/*b)  How many patients had at least 1 emergency room encounter that started in 2003? 
Again, will be creating a separate dataset, so Steps 1-2 from partA are the same for this partB*/

/*ANSWER: based on the log, the final dataset had N=7241 observations.Since we had already made this dataset to only include EMERG
encounters (so every patient has at least one EMERG) AND we had flat filed it by patient id, there should only 
be one row per patient, so N=7241 is the # of patients that had 1 or more EMERG encounters.*/

/*c) How many patients had at least 1 visit of either type (inpatient or emergency room encounter) that started 
in 2003?
Again, Steps 1-2 from Part A are the same here*/

/*flat file by patient id and creating count variable (which since all the observations
in this final dataset will have at least 1 EMERG or INPT, then this count variable 
will be counting the number of encounters/patient*/

/*ANSWER: From the log, N=10305. Since every patient in this dataset has at least 1 EMERG or INPT encounter, the total
# of observations is also equivalent to the # of patients with 1+ EMERG/INPT encounters, thus the answer is 10,305 patients.*/

/*d) In patients from c) who had at least 1 visit of either type, create a variable that counts the total number 
encounters (of either type)*/
